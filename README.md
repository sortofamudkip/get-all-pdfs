# get all pdfs
Gets all the PDFs of a web page. 

Make sure you change the `WEBPAGE` and `DOMAIN` variables before running the program.

I made this because I didn't want to click to download every PDF of my class' websites.

## Usage
```
python links.py
```

## External modules
Uses `bs4` and `requests`. If you don't have them, you can type `pip install bs4` and `pip install requests`.
